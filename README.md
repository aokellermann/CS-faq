# CS-faq
This repo is an open source resource page for CS majors at UML

The topics are organized into different documents. `FAQ.md` contains general questions and answers and `CLASSES.md` contains advice for specific classes.

Anyone who has a piece of advise is welcome to write it up and submit a pull request so it can be merged into the final document.
